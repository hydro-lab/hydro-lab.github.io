## Summary of Reference Values  

|Source |Activity (pCi/L) |Activity (Bq/m<sup>3</sup>) |  
|---|---|---|  
|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency<sup>1</sup> |**4** |148 <sup>3</sup> |  
|World Health Organization<sup>2</sup> |2.7 <sup>3</sup> |**100** |  

1. The [USEPA](https://www.epa.gov/radon/what-epas-action-level-radon-and-what-does-it-mean) also recommends mitigation over 2 pCi/L.  
2. The [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/radon-and-health) recommends that countries set a reference level of 100 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>; however, if that is not possible, that it not exceed 300 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>.  
3. **Bold** values are the reference values, other values are provided for alternate units.

## Project Links  
This study is to quantify the radon present in homes and determine if awareness and education prompts those with radon present to mitigate radon risk.  This preliminary study will be used to estimate if a broader employee wellness program is well suited to assist employees make their home safer. This includes a participant placing a test kit in their home (provided by the study), reporting the results, and responding to surveys. All participants be provided standardized information on radon risk and mitigation from Pennsylvania and U.S. government sources.  If the levels of radon tested exceed standard levels (participants will be informed of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency action level and the World Health Organization recommendations), we will provide mitigation recommendations again.  We will also ask three months after the test if mitigation steps have been taken. All information will be kept confidential and not attached to your address, but there is always a risk of a loss of confidentiality.
