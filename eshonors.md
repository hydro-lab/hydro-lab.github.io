# Environmental Science Honors Program  
The Environmental Science Honors Program sets forth the requirements for honors recognition by the department.  Honors are in recognition of superior performance in environmental science. This includes coursework, scientific research, and engagement in environmental science cocurricular activities.  The program establishes the opportunity for the student to function as a scientist and demonstrate the integration of the student’s academic preparation and research skills into a demonstration of the scientific method to contribute to the field of environmental science (in certain cases, the engineering design process may be used).  The thesis, the final requirement of honors recognition, must incorporate appropriate literature review and scientific research including appropriate analysis with conclusions.  

## Requirements:  
Interested students should discuss their intention to seek honors recognition with their faculty mentor early in the student’s career.  The recognition of departmental honors is earned by students for their performance in several fields; therefore, there are few strict cutoffs for each requirement.  Each student must apply and be accepted by the program.  
- Progression towards the major in Environmental Science  
- Research experience prior to the fourth year (or prior to last two-semesters)  
- Sufficient academic performance  
- Demonstrated cocurricular engagement  
- Application and acceptance into the program  
- Completion of the research preparation activities (as part of the graduate student seminar course)  
- A successfully defended thesis (document and presentation)  

## Application Process:
A completed application is due to the Environmental Science Honors Program 15 April of the calendar year prior to your anticipated graduation year.  An application package includes:  
- Application form (attached)  
- Resume or CV (two-page maximum)  
- Transcript (unofficial is acceptable)  
- Project summary that explains the background, proposed activities, and intellectual merit and broader impacts of the project (one-page maximum)  

The application deadline was set to ensure that accepted students will have the opportunity to take the required pre-thesis course, ENVI 414H (1 credit), which is offered only in the fall. This course may not be taken concurrently with ENVI 415H.  Students should plan to allocate credits for research in both semesters of their fourth year (or last two-semesters).  

Note: For more information on intellectual merit and broader impacts, see the National Science Foundation's [Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg19_1/pappg_3.jsp).  

## Timeline  
Use this timeline to determine the deadlines and timing for required courses (this does not include your qualifying research experience):  

|Intended graduation|Fall|Spring|Summer|Fall|Spring|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|August|ENVI414H|ENVI390|ENVI415H, Graduate| | |
|December|ENVI414H|ENVI390|ENVI390*, URP|ENVI415H, Graduate| |
|May| | | |ENVI414H, ENVI390|ENVI415H, Graduate|  

'* only for those students who wish to conduct research during the summer for credit.  Exceptions may be made if the student is accepted into the Undergraduate Research Program.  It is not required for students to conduct research in both the summer and preceding spring; however, it is an option.  

## Research Experience
The research experience requirements must be satisfied by student participation in scientific research activities as defined in the legislation concerning the Department of Health and Human Services, 45 CFR 46.102:  

> *Research* means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Activities which meet this definition constitute research for purposes of this policy, whether or not they are conducted or supported under a program which is considered research for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may include research activities.  

This is typically done with through ENVI 390: Undergraduate Research-Environmental, for credit, or the Undergraduate Research Program.  In rare circumstances, the student may petition the department to accept work conducted as part of an internship; however, the work must satisfy the definition of scientific research and engage the scientific method.  Regardless, the experience must have research as a learning objective (as in ENVI 390) established prior to the commencement of that experience.  At least one-credit, or equivalent, must be taken prior to application for the program.  

## Thesis Research and Thesis Preparation  
Research for the thesis must span a minimum of two consecutive semesters but is likely to be a continuation of the student’s previous research experience.  Most students will choose to complete these required semesters in the fourth year of study.  Students must enroll for ENVI 390 in the first semester and ENVI 415H in the second semester.  

An outline of the thesis is due to the program on the first Monday of February and the final written document is due the second Monday of April.  

The thesis document and presentation are prepared and approved by the faculty mentor before it is submitted for defense before the program.  The defense, which will include the presentation, will be scheduled by the student with the department and may be part of several presentations.  

## Application  
Due 15 April of the calendar year prior to the student’s anticipated graduation.  [Apply](https://forms.gle/q97XbPESeehkH2Lt5) via Google Forms.
