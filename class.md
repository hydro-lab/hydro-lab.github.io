### Evaluation Policies
Homework will be due in class on the due date.  Late homework may only earn half credit and will not be accepted more than three school days late; furthermore, assignments will not be accepted after the last day of classes.  Exceptions to any due dates or exams must be arranged well in advance and via e-mail.  See instructor for family or personal emergencies.  

### Academic Integrity  
Students must adhere to the [Duquesne University](https://www.duq.edu/academics/university-catalogs/2023-2024-catalog/graduate/academic-policies/academic-integrity.php) and [Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences](https://www.duq.edu/documents/academics/colleges-and-schools/science/sose-academic-integrity.pdf) policies on academic integrity. Examples of prohibited activities include, but are not limited to, cheating, falsification or alteration of data, misrepresentation of another's work, and plagiarism.  

The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been discussed at length recently.  The rules that I set forth for generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, Google Workspace Labs) apply only to my classes and may not reflect anyone else's course policies.  I encourage all of my students to become familiar with generative AI technologies and use them in coursework.  There are two things I ask of my students:  
- If the assignment does not require the use of a generative AI tool and you choose to use one, please add a statement within the acknowledgements or references section that discloses the use of generative AI, such as:  

```
The author(s) used [name of generative AI] to [REASON].  The author(s) reviewed and edited the content as needed and take(s) full responsibility for the content.
```
This was adapted from the Elsevier journal [guidance](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/publishing-ethics/the-use-of-ai-and-ai-assisted-writing-technologies-in-scientific-writing) on generative AI.  
- If the assignment requires the use of generative AI, the student is responsible for doing the assignment with enough time to allow for these often free tools to be unavailable.  

**No matter what,** you are responsible for what you turn in.  If the generative AI makes a mistake and you submit it, it is now your mistake.  

### Responsible Conduct of Research  
Students engaged in research shall adhere to applicable University policies and State, Federal, and International laws, as well as funding agency requirements and any applicable regulations.  Generally, this prohibits falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism.  Furthermore, students involved in research with human subjects must obtain training and have the protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board.  

### University Solidarity
In alignment with Duquesne Universityâ€™s mission, out of a profound concern for moral and spiritual values, we are committed to maintaining an ecumenical  atmosphere open and committed to diversity and an inclusive learning environment. As a faculty member here at Duquesne, I acknowledge the existence of systemic racism, racial inequality, microaggressions and other forms of racial abuse, racial trauma, and the long history of racial injustice in our society. I acknowledge the effect COVID-19 has had on the Black, Indigenous, and Latinx communities.  I acknowledge the disproportionate rates of   infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in these communities locally, nationally, and globally.  I also acknowledge that the most recent acts of Anti-Black violence are both tragic and traumatic, and impact members of our community. I acknowledge that racist attacks against Asians, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) have increased markedly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this, I am committed to providing a learning environment inclusive of all experiences and perspectives, and particularly respectful of the most marginalized in our society.  In recognition of the reality of microaggressions and racial trauma, I am committed to sharing campus resources that provide spaces supportive of Black students and BIPOC students--Black Indigenous People of Color (see below). Please feel free to use these resources.  As your instructor, I honor and respect the multiple intersecting identities of all  students in the classroom, including BIPOC students, undocumented and immigrant students, AAPI students, LGBTQIA+ students, emergent bilinguals, students with disabilities, and more.  I stand with you in stating that your life matters and your learning experience here as a member of the BIPOC community at Duquesne matters.

### Academic Accommodations  
The [Office of Disability Services](https://www.duq.edu/about/accessibility/disability-services.php), Union 309, is responsible for determining reasonable accommodations and for assisting students in communicating these to faculty. Student should notify instructors, at the beginning of the term, if any reasonable accommodations are needed; students must be registered with Disability Services. The instructor shall receive confirmation of the reasonable accommodations from the office before accommodations will be granted.
