# Research Ethics
Ethics and the responsible conduct of research (RCR) is fundamental; however, this topic is largely overlooked in the training of scientists and engineers.  The following resources are provided to supplement any formal training:



National Society of Professional Engineers Code of Ethics: https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics

American Geophysical Union Scientific Integrity and Professional Ethics:

Duquesne University Research:

Students working on hydrology research should expect to take:
- Physical Science Responsible Conduct of Research  
- Social & Behavioral Research Basic/Refresher  

Human Subjects Protections  
Some research conducted may involve human subjects.  Any researcher involved in research that involves human subjects must follow institutional guidelines.  The best place to start is with the Institutional Review Board:

Any students that engage in research with human subjects should take the appropriate IRB course, likely that for Social/Behavioral/Educational research.
