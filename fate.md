## Course Description
The fate and transport of substances in the environment can be simulated by several mathematical models.  This course provides the mathematical basis, computational modeling context, and practical experience with common computational models.  Specifically, mass balance, degradation, sorption, speciation, diffusion, transport of admixtures, and groundwater will be considered.  Pre-requisite: Calculus I, Environmental Chemistry, or permission of the instructor.  

## Textbook
[Pollutant Fate and Transport in Environmental Multimedia](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Pollutant+Fate+and+Transport+in+Environmental+Multimedia-p-9781119414629)  
By Frank M. Dunnivant, Elliot Anders  
ISBN: 978-1-119-41462-9  

## Internet Resources  
Canvas is the official course website as it is the official method of communications at the University; however, this website is the primary location for course information.  Box will also be used to share presentations, data, notes, and other items.  This syllabus is subject to change; the updated syllabus will be available on this website.  

Students must have *access* to a computer running Windows 7 or higher; although, any computer with word processing and spreadsheets will be sufficient for routine work.  

### Software packages  
- [Textbook](https://sites.google.com/a/whitman.edu/frank-dunnivant-webpage/environmentalsoftware)  
- [Minteq](https://vminteq.lwr.kth.se/)

### Class Notes  
Class notes are available on a dynamic Google doc (this is not a replacement for notes in class):  
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Glu4YVzrBd1Vb8NBpd6cjkDLx4QI3rKECcA3CqS-B50/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Glu4YVzrBd1Vb8NBpd6cjkDLx4QI3rKECcA3CqS-B50/edit?usp=sharing)  

## Objectives 
Students will be able to:
- qualitatively and quantitatively describe fundamental environmental fluid flow;  
- identify and show mathematically how admixtures and substances move in the environment; and  
- evaluate numerical model limitations and operate several basic environmental models.  

## Evaluation
- 25% Exam 1  
- 25% Exam 2  
- 50% Homework, labs (including computational), and projects  

Homework will be due in class on the due date.  Late homework may only earn half credit and will not be accepted more than three school days late.  Exceptions to any due dates or exams must be arranged well in advance and via e-mail.  See instructor for family or personal emergencies.  

## Course Policies  
Course policies that cover academic integrity, academic accommodations, and class procedures is available on the course website.
