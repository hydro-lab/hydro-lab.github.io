# Pure Thirst  
Pure Thirst is a student group that seeks to learn more about water and health issues that face the world, particularly in low- and middle-income counties (LMIC).  The group works on laboratory and field research on a range of water and health issues, raises awareness on global water issues, and engages with communities facing water issues to better understand how water affects health and society.  

Historically, Pure Thirst has worked with several communities around the world.  For several years, the group worked with the Olkokola community in Arusha Region, Tanzania.  Due to COVID-19, the group has not been able to travel to Tanzania.  In 2023, after planning a return to Olkokola, a nearby outbreak caused those plans to be thwarted once again.  In 2023, the group will conduct a project in the Dzimauli communities in Limpopo, South Africa.
