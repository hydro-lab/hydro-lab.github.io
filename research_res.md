# Research Resources  

## Thesis  
Remember to plan your thesis document preparation, defense, and revisions ahead of the [ETD deadlines](https://guides.library.duq.edu/etd).  

## Duquesne Weather Station  
The Duquesne Weather Station is located the roof of Mellon Hall on a 3 m mast.  More available on the [weather station page](/weather.html) or about wind energy potential [wind power siting](/wind.html).  

## Meteorological Data  
Finding reliable weather station data can be a challenge.  While some may be tempted to search a commercial site for data, research data should be obtained by a professional, verifiable source.  The National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly the National Climatic Data Center), part of NOAA, houses data from around the world.  To search for data from within the United States, I recommend using their Find a Station tool:  
- [https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/findstation](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/findstation)  

Internationally, search the Climate Data Online database:  
- [https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)  

In South Africa, the Department of Water and Sanitation, Hydrological Services maintains a database:  
- [http://www.dwa.gov.za/Hydrology/](http://www.dwa.gov.za/Hydrology/)  

## Water Resources Data  
Finding reliable water resources data can be a challenge.  In the United States, we are extremely fortunate to have the data maintained by the USGS.  You can search for data through the National Water Information System; I recommend, as a starting point, looking under surface water and then daily data.:  
- [https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis](https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)  

In South Africa, the Department of Water and Sanitation, Hydrological Services maintains a stream gage network along with other data:  
- [https://www.dws.gov.za/Hydrology/Default.aspx](https://www.dws.gov.za/Hydrology/Default.aspx)

Internationally, you may request data from the Global Runoff Data Center:

## Literature Review  
The Duquesne Library has a number of great research databases available on campus.  The largest general science and engineering database available is Scopus.  These are found on the library research page:
https://guides.library.duq.edu/az.php

One of the most frustrating aspects of literature review is tracking citations.  I recommend finding a citation software that you like and sticking with it.  Two features are very useful and have become standard: word processing integration (e.g., MS Word plugin) and web importers (buttons that automatically download the citation data).  More information can be found on the library website:
http://guides.library.duq.edu/citation_management

I have found that Mendeley satisfies all of my needs.  Mendeley has a web-based and 
desktop interface and the website has a number of other features such as a grant database, recommendations for papers, and a data repository.

## Fieldwork Safety Plan
This plan is for internal use only.  Others may use or modify; however, the PI, the University, or any funding agency claims no responsibility for any of the material.  In general, safety plans should not be used without proper training.  

## Fieldwork Safety Guidelines
USGS Guide for Safe Field Operations  

## Laboratory Safety
Duquesne University provides online laboratory safety training and several laboratory safety resources:
- [http://www.duq.edu/about/departments-and-offices/environmental-health-and-safety/training](http://www.duq.edu/about/departments-and-offices/environmental-health-and-safety/training)  
- [http://www.duq.edu/about/departments-and-offices/environmental-health-and-safety/lab-safety](http://www.duq.edu/about/departments-and-offices/environmental-health-and-safety/lab-safety)  

Always report any injuries to the PI immediately.
