# Field Environmental Science in South Africa  
## Short-Term Study Abroad  
This is a three-week intensive science course in South Africa.  The course is open to undergraduates and graduate students, and available to any Duquesne University student with adequate math preparation to at least college algebra (see instructor if you are unsure).  For more program information:  
- See the tentative syllabus below  
- View the [information sheet](https://duq.box.com/s/7msosgk2z8nu759wyb06w5kpf8iip3jw)  
- The *Center for Global Engagement* oversees the [application and enrollment](https://www.duq.edu/academics/study-abroad)  

## ENVI 405 Syllabus  
*4 credits*  
### Instructor  
David Kahler  
Center for Environmental Research and Education  
Office: Fisher 333A  
Lab: Fisher 339A  

### Course Description
The purpose of this academic program is to teach students field methods and data analysis in environmental science, specifically, hydrology and biodiversity.  The course will also provide students the historical context of apartheid and give them examples of existing post-apartheid disparities in South Africa.  This is hand-in-hand with the environmental science field methods introduced, as it is marginalized populations that do not have equal or equitable access to infrastructure or environmental quality interventions.  

This course will be conducted at [Kruger National Park](https://tropicalstudies.org/portfolio/skukuza-research-station/).  

#### Course Attributes  
This course satisfies:  
- Environmental Science field course requirement  
- Bridges *Social and Historical Reasoning* requirement
- Bridges *Quantitative and Scientific Reasoning* requirement
- Bridges *Experiential Learning Opportunity*  

### Required Textbook and Materials  
- *Born a Crime* By Trevor Noah  
- Rite in the Rain Weatherproof Hardcover notebook, 4.75”x7.5”, 350F  
- Laptop computer with ability to run on 230VAC/50Hz  

### Objectives  
By the end of the program, students will:
- be proficient with field techniques (see below)  
-demonstrate an understanding of mathematical concepts through visual representations, the use of formulas and numerical processes (QSR2)  
-	think critically about the use of quantitative data, in the connections between hydrology, water quality, and biodiversity (QSR3)  
-	analyze issues of measurement and modeling for water security and transboundary water management through literature and in-depth investigation to develop informed positions (QSR5)  
-	apply scientific reasoning to propose and test hypotheses and formulate sound, logical arguments using scientific data taken by the student groups along with data from repositories (QSR4)  
-	think critically about the development and interaction of individuals, groups, organizations, systems, and communities as it pertains to eco-tourism and environmental conservation (e.g., the southern white rhinoceros horn market) (SHR4)  
-	develop greater awareness, analytic abilities, and critical capacities concerning contemporary and historical context of apartheid and colonialism as it pertains to environmental health (SHR5)  

### Field Techniques  
- GPS use (satellites, importing data to GIS)  
- Record keeping (lab notebooks, chain-of-custody)  
- Hydrology measurement (river discharge, land cover, evaporation)  
- Meteorological measurement (sensors, data management)  
- Water quality measurement (sensors, calibration, operating limitations): pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, anion/cation measurement, bacteria)  
- River health (macroinvertebrate surveys, fish)  

### Evaluation  
70% Periodic assignments will cover field/lab activities, new skills, and historical context.  This may include quizzes.
30% Group project, which will allow students to design, collect data, and make conclusions based on their results.
All policies for the instructor apply to this course: [https://hydro-lab.github.io/class.html](https://hydro-lab.github.io/class.html).  This includes academic integrity and student accomodations.  Any student that requires accomodations must notify the instructor at registration due to the travel involved.
