### Course Description
The purpose of this academic program is to teach students field methods and data analysis in environmental science, specifically, hydrology and biodiversity.  The course will also provide students the historical context of apartheid and give them examples of existing post-apartheid disparities in South Africa.  This is hand-in-hand with the environmental science field methods introduced, as it is marginalized populations that do not have equal or equitable access to infrastructure or environmental quality interventions.  

This course will be hosted at Kruger National Park in South Africa as well as other field sites including University of Venda.
