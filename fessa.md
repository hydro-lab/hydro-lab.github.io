# Field Environmental Science in South Africa  
## Short-Term Study Abroad  
This is a three-week intensive science course in South Africa.  The course is open to undergraduates and graduate students, and available to any Duquesne University student with adequate math preparation to at least algebra (see instructor if you are unsure).  For more program information:

- The *Center for Global Engagement* oversees the [application and enrollment](https://www.duq.edu/academics/study-abroad) (coming soon)  

## ENVI 405 Syllabus  
*4 credits*  
### Instructor  
David Kahler  
Center for Environmental Research and Education  
Office: Fisher 333A  
Lab: Fisher 339A  

### Course Description
The purpose of this academic program is to teach students field methods and data analysis in environmental science, specifically, hydrology and biodiversity.  The course will also provide students the historical context of apartheid and give them examples of existing post-apartheid disparities in South Africa.  This is hand-in-hand with the environmental science field methods introduced, as it is marginalized populations that do not have equal or equitable access to infrastructure or environmental quality interventions.  

This course will be conducted at [Kruger National Park](https://tropicalstudies.org/portfolio/skukuza-research-station/) and [University of Venda](https://www.univen.ac.za/).  

### Required Textbook and Materials  
- *Born a Crime* By Trevor Noah  
- Rite in the Rain Weatherproof Hardcover notebook, 4.75”x7.5”, 350F  
- Laptop computer with ability to run on 230VAC/50Hz  

### Objectives  
By the end of the program, students will:
- be proficient with field techniques  
- identify the interconnections between hydrology, water quality, and biodiversity  
- apply water security concepts in local and transboundary watersheds and recognize potential issues that face marginalized populations  
- Demonstrate an understanding of mathematical concepts through visual representations, the use of formulas and numerical processes (QR2)  
- Think critically about the use of quantitative data, in authentic contexts and everyday life situations (e.g., the use of statistics in risk assessment; calculating interest rates; polling data; and burden/benefit analysis) (QR3)  
- apply scientific reasoning to propose and test hypotheses and formulate sound, logical arguments using scientific data taken by the student groups with data from repositories (QSR4)  
- analyze current scientific topics through literature and in-depth investigation to develop informed positions (QSR5)  

### Field Techniques  
- GPS use (satellites, importing data)  
- Record keeping (lab notebooks, chain-of-custody)  
- Hydrology measurement (river discharge, land cover, evaporation)  
- Meteorological measurement (sensors, data management)  
- Water quality measurement (sensors, calibration, operating limitations): pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, anion/cation measurement, bacteria)  
- River health (macroinvertebrate surveys, fish)
