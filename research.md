## Undergraduate Research  
Undergraduate students have several opportunities to do research.  Students should discuss potential research activities with faculty.  During the semester students can do research for credit and enroll in ENVI 390: Undergraduate Research (specify the facutly during enrollment, there are different section numbers).  During the summer, students can apply for the [Undergraduate Research Program](https://www.duq.edu/academics/schools/natural-and-environmental-sciences/undergraduate-research) (URP), which provides housing and stipend for 10 weeks.  Applications are typically due in February or March.  Undergraduates may also wish to look at the NSF-sponsored [Research Experience for Undergraduates](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) program.  

Duquesne University also offers the [Honors Thesis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h_d4PMVz21F_MJPQXK4ohUgkycKG1AQ0DKGkeDLLch8/edit?usp=sharing) in Environmental Science.  Students must have some research experience prior to their year of graduation and apply to the Honors Program.  

## Graduate Research
Graduate students who pursue a thesis should consider ENVI 700: Thesis Research.  Research topics should be selected early in the program to allow for adaquate time to complete the work.  In this research group, students prepare an NSF-style research proposal in the early stages of their work, which includes a substantial literature review.  NSF's instructions are found in NSF's [Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg); the actual research proposal and biographical sketch are the key elements at this stage, see chapter 2.
