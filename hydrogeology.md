## Course Description
Hydrology (literally, the study of water) in the environment considers the water cycle, including the atmosphere (boundary-layer movement and mixing of heat and water vapor), surface water (river flow, overland flow, surface-ground interactions), and groundwater (Darcyâ€™s Law, diffusion, media characteristics).  This course will cover these topics with a special focus on groundwater and interactions in the subsurface.  Special applications include contaminant transport and groundwater remediation.  Computational hydrologic models will also be introduced.

Students also **must** have access to a Windows computer for the hydrologic models.  

## Course Website
Blackboard is the official course website as it is the official method of communications at the University; however, this website and associated blog will be the primary source of information.  Box will also be used to share datasets.  This syllabus is subject to change; the updated syllabus will be available on the course website.

## Objectives
Students will:
- have a strong working knowledge of the concepts and terminology used for describing various fluxes and stores within the hydrologic cycle;  
- be able to apply mathematical methods to estimate hydrologic processes;  
- critically analyze model applications and results for planning purposes (e.g., environmental flow); and  
- recognize, determine data requirements, and analyze field and model data for typical groundwater contamination.  

## Evaluation  
- 15% Exam #1  
- 15% Exam #2  
- 15% HEC-HMS Project  
- 15% Infiltration lab report
