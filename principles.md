## Course Description
Environmental science is an interdisciplinary field that considers the interactions between humans and the environment.  This course will use the tools of biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics to examine historically important and current events in environmental science.  Environmental research and challenges are presented.  Frameworks such as systems thinking and ecosystem services are used to organize thought around environmental issues.  The use of computers and programming for environmental models and data analysis will be performed.  

## Textbook and course materials
*[Introduction to Environmental Engineering](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Mines-Introduction-to-Environmental-Engineering/PGM289634.html)*  
Mines and Lackey (Pearson)  
ISBN: 978-0-13-234747-1  

Additionally, students will need access to a computer (not a tablet or Chromebook) with:

- Microsoft Excel: https://www.duq.edu/about/campus/computing-and-technology-services/software-catalog/microsoft-office  
- QGIS: https://www.qgis.org/en/site/  

Students should bring to class a computer or tablet that is capable of using Canvas for quizzes or looking up materials.

## Objectives 
Students will be able to:
- recognize complex relationships that weave together the multi-disciplinary field of environmental science;
- evaluate scientific claims from environmental science;
- recognize the role of environmental science in development and environmental conservation, and;
- apply quantitative and qualitative research methods to the analysis of environmental issues present in todayâ€™s society and economy.  

## Evaluation
- 40% Assignments  
- 20% Exam 1  
- 20% Exam 2  
- 20% Exam 3  

Homework will be due in class on the due date.  Late homework may only earn half credit and will not be accepted more than three school days late.  Exceptions to any due dates or exams must be arranged well in advance and via e-mail.  See instructor for family or personal emergencies.

## Course Policies
Course policies are available on the [Course Policies](https://hydro-lab.github.io/coursepolicies.html) page.  Additionally:  
### Academic integrity
Students must adhere to the [Duquesne University](https://www.duq.edu/academics/university-catalogs/2021-2022-undergraduate/academic-policies/academic-integrity) and [Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences](https://www.duq.edu/academics/schools/natural-and-environmental-sciences/academics/departments-and-programs/academic-integrity-policy) policies on academic integrity.  Examples of prohibited activities include, but are not limited to, cheating, falsification or alteration of data, misrepresentation of another's work, and plagiarism.  
### Student accommodations  
The Office of Disability Services (Links to an external site.), Union 309, is responsible for determining reasonable accommodations and for assisting students in communicating these to faculty.  Student should notify instructors, at the beginning of the term, if any reasonable accommodations are needed; students must be registered with Disability Services.  The instructor shall receive confirmation of the reasonable accommodations from the office before accommodations will be granted.
