### Example problem  
This example uses a long time series from New York City and examines the rain after hurricane Ida.  Check out the example posted in the *hydrostats* package [repository](https://github.com/LimpopoLab/hydrostats) or the example [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LimpopoLab/hydrostats/main/precip_evi.R).  The example uses the lognormal distribution as well as the extreme value type I distribution.
