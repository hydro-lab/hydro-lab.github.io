As an example of the surface energy budget, I have shown one day from the ARM site in Oklahoma.  The net radiation, sensible heat, and latent heat fluxes are shown, as is the Bowen ratio.  

Data are from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility. 2016. Energy Balance Bowen Ratio Station (30EBBR). 1993-07-04 to 2021-09-06, Southern Great Plains (SGP) Lamont, OK (Extended and Co-located with C1) (E13). Compiled by D. Cook, R. Sullivan, D. Whiteman, E. Keeler and B. Ermold. ARM Data Center. Data set accessed 2021-09-08 at [http://dx.doi.org/10.5439/1025337](http://dx.doi.org/10.5439/1025337).
