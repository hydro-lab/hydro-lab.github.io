### ENVI 591: Hydrogeology 
Permeameter lab due 04 November.  Your write-up should include a methods, results, and conclusions section.  In your methods, please develop the hydraulic conductivity formula from Darcy's Law and explain the permeameter setup.  Present the data and calculated hydraulic conductivity in the results section.  In the conclusions section, explain the limitations of the permeameter, as used, to determine hydraulic conductivity.
