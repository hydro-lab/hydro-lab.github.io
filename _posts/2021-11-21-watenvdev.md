## Water, Environment, and Development homework due 30 November 2021  
Please complete the water footprint packet.  Step 4 focuses on specific elements of your water footprint and the origin of those elements.  The link in the packet is incorrect; please see [Water Footprint Assessment Tool](https://www.waterfootprintassessmenttool.org/).  For your analysis, pick any approximate origin of one of your water footprint elements (perhaps a food) and investigate the water at the origin.  You will see that Step 5 consists of group discussions; please prepare for these for this week.  Since we have periodically discussed this, we will likely not dedicate the full 1.5 hours, but we will spend some time on it on Thursday.  

Happy Thanksgiving!
