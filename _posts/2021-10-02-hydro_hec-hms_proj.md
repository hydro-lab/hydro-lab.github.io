### ENVI 591: Hydrogeology 
HEC-HMS project due 19 October.  Your project consists of an analysis of one-year of precipitation and river discharge data from a watershed.  You should be able to find all of the data needed from USGS and NOAA:  
- [USGS Streamstats](https://streamstats.usgs.gov/ss/)  
- [USGS NWIS](https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis)  
- [NOAA NCEI](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/)  

You will parameterize your HEC-HMS model with at least daily data and run the model to simulate one year.  Your output hydrograph should then be compared to the river discharge data.  You should run the simulation with:  
Infiltration models:  
- Green-Ampt  
- SCS Curve number  
and hydrograph transform models:  
- Unit-hydrograph derived from your data  
- SCS dimensionless hydrograph with parameters from your data  

Your final report will include:
- Information about your watershed (size, location, average temperature, average annual precipitation, climate)  
- Parameters for each model you used  
- Which combination of models best simulated your data  
- Best output modeled hydrograph, actual hydrograph, and precipitation.
