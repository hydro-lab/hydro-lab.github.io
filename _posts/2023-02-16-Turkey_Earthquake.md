Not much of an update, I've just started looking into the earthquake that recently devistated parts of Turkey. I just put 33 pairs into the queue in ASF and now I just have to wait for them to finish. Other than that, I'm just waiting on Gabi to finish with ENVI and I'll start working on PS for the dam.

Notes for Will
-Get IT to fix computer so I can actually access ENVI
