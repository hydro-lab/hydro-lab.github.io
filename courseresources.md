## Scientific Calculators
Students may wish to use a calculator for coursework and exams.  In some classes, this may be necessary.  Scientific calculators are an important resource and students should select one that suits all of their current and expected needs.  This allows students to get used to one calculator.  This is important because all calculators behave slightly differently.  Furthermore, if you think you will take engineering classes or take engineering license exams, please consider a [NCEES-approved calculator](https://ncees.org/exams/calculator/).
