<h1>Prospective Students</h1>
<h2>Undergraduate Students</h2>
<p>Duquesne University offers an undergraduate degree (B.S.) in <a href="https://duq.edu/academics/schools/natural-and-environmental-sciences/academics/departments-and-programs/environmental-science-and-environmental-science-and-management/undergraduate-programs">Environmental Science</a> as well as a <a href="https://duq.edu/academics/schools/natural-and-environmental-sciences/academics/departments-and-programs/environmental-science-and-environmental-science-and-management/undergraduate-programs/bs-in-environmental-science-curriculum/minors-in-env-science-and-env-studies">minor</a> in both Environmental Science and Studies.  High school students should indicate Environmental Science in the Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences on their <a href="https://www.duq.edu/admissions-and-aid/apply">application</a> if they wish to pursue an environmental science degree.  Minors may be declared by any major.  Please note the prerequisites for the Minor in Environmental Science as they are extensive and may be best suited to other science majors.  Please contact the department if you would like assistance with these minors.</p>
<h2>Graduate Students</h2>
<p>Graduate admissions are handled at the department level, as it is in most universities.  There is a central application website, but there are specific requirements for the <a href="https://duq.edu/academics/schools/natural-and-environmental-sciences/academics/departments-and-programs/environmental-science-and-management/graduate-programs/graduate-program-admissions">Environmental Science and Management</a> degree (M.S.).  Please contact the department for guidance.  There are several tracks from which to choose.</p>
<p>Students who wish to complete a Master's Thesis should find a potential research topic as soon as possible.  The best way to do this is to look at the <a href="https://duq.edu/academics/schools/natural-and-environmental-sciences/academics/departments-and-programs/environmental-science-and-management/about/faculty-and-staff">research currently conducted and faculty research interests</a> for a match.  Students should contact potential research supervisors as early as possible - even before they apply if reasonable.</p>
<p>Funding for graduate students will only be considered for students who apply before the March deadline for Fall admissions.  Funding can come from teaching assistant or research assistant positions.  Teaching assignments are made by the department admissions committee; research assignments are made by the principal investigator, if available.</p>
<p>International students should also take care to contact potential supervisors early.  Please note that Duquesne's aggressive e-mail filter blocks (either outright or puts in "junk mail") the vast majority of e-mail from outside the United States.  It may be helpful to contact potential supervisors via social media (e.g., LinkedIn or ResearchGate).</p>
