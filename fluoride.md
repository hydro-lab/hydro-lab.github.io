# Defluoridation
*part of Duquesne's Pure Thirst program in Tanzania*  

At low concentrations, fluoride is beneficial to teeth and bones; however, at higher concentrations, fluoride can cause dental and skeletal fluorosis.  Some regions of northern Tanzania have naturally occurring high concentrations of fluoride in their drinking water.  This research seeks a technology to reduce the fluoride in drinking water.
